#+TITLE: Using the Julia programming language with Amazon SageMaker Studio Lab

Julia is a programming language for technical computing, designed to
be both high-level like Python or R, while also having
high performance similar to Fortran or C.

This directory contains Jupyter notebook examples for installing and
working with Julia in SageMaker Studio Lab. Jupyter (the name is a
mashup of Julia, Python, and R) is a natural place to explore data
analysis and machine learning with Julia.
