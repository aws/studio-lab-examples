### Stable Diffusion Finetune

This is a project originally from [SageMaker JumpStart](https://github.com/aws/amazon-sagemaker-examples/blob/main/introduction_to_amazon_algorithms/jumpstart_text_to_image)

This notebook Amazon_JumpStart_Text_To_Image.ipynb demos how to use JumpStart to generate image conditioned on text that appears indistinguishable from a real images. You can also fine-tune the model on your dataset.
