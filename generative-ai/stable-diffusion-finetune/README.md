### Stable Diffusion Finetune

This is a project originally from [SageMaker JumpStart](https://github.com/aws/amazon-sagemaker-examples/blob/main/introduction_to_amazon_algorithms/jumpstart_text_to_image)

The notebook `Amazon_JumpStart_Text_To_Image.ipynb` demos how to use JumpStart to generate image conditioned on text that appears indistinguishable from a real images. You can also fine-tune the model on your dataset.

The notebook `custom_dog_image_generator.ipynb` demos how to use custom dataset to generate text-to-image model.
