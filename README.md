## SageMaker Studio Lab Examples

Example Jupyter notebooks that demonstrate how to build AI/ML learning environment using Amazon SageMaker Studio Lab.

## :books: Background

SageMaker Studio Lab is a service for individual data scientist who wants to develop the career toward AI/ML practitioner. You can start your ML journey for free.

This repository introduces you to the way to set up Studio Lab according to your interest area, such as computer vision, natural language processing, etc. And also, we show how to deploy your project to the [Amazon SageMaker](https://github.com/aws/amazon-sagemaker-examples) to become the AI/ML practitioner.

## :hammer_and_wrench: Setup

Please follow the [Onboard to Amazon SageMaker Studio Lab](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/studio-lab-onboard.html).

1. Request a Studio Lab account
2. Create a Studio Lab account
3. Sign in to Studio Lab

## :computer: Usage

There are 2 ways to use examples.

1. **Read**: You can read the notebook in Studio Lab without Studio Lab account. Please feel free to push **Open in Studio Lab** button in Examples section.
2. **Run**: You can run the notebook by copying the notebook or `git clone` the repository to your Studio Lab project.
3. **Share**: You can share the notebooks through the Git repository such as GitHub. [If you add Open in Studio Lab button](open-in-studio-lab), the readers can copy the notebook or clone the repository by clicking button.

### [Custom Environments](custom-environments/)

We provide `.yml` files to set up various programming language / framework environments. To use the `.yml` file, please proceed with the following instruction.

1. Click this button right here --> [![Open in SageMaker Studio Lab](https://studiolab.sagemaker.aws/studiolab.svg)](https://studiolab.sagemaker.aws/import/github/aws/studio-lab-examples/blob/main/custom-environments/custom_environment.ipynb)
2. Click the `Copy to Project` button
   * Sign-in and `Start runtime` is needed before it.
3. When prompted, select `Clone Entire Repo`
4. Click `Clone` after confirming `Open README files.` is checked.
   * When `No Conda environment file found` shown, please `Dismiss`.
5. Once opening `README.md` preview, please move to `Custom Environments` section and click the programming language / specific framework environment link as you need to open `.yml` file.
6. Right click the opened `.yml` file tab and select `Show in File Browser`.
7. Right click the `.yml` file in the file browser and select `Build Conda Environment`.
8. Once command completed, please run notebook in the same folder to check the environment. When prompted `Select Kearnel`, please select the created environment.
