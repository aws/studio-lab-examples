## SageMaker Studio Lab Examples

Example Jupyter notebooks that demonstrate how to build AI/ML learning environment using Amazon SageMaker Studio Lab.

## :books: Background

SageMaker Studio Lab is a service for individual data scientist who wants to develop the career toward AI/ML practitioner. You can start your ML journey for free.

This repository introduces you to the way to set up Studio Lab according to your interest area, such as computer vision, natural language processing, etc. And also, we show how to deploy your project to the [Amazon SageMaker](https://github.com/aws/amazon-sagemaker-examples) to become the AI/ML practitioner.

## :hammer_and_wrench: Setup

Please follow the [Onboard to Amazon SageMaker Studio Lab](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/studio-lab-onboard.html).

1. Request a Studio Lab account
2. Create a Studio Lab account
3. Sign in to Studio Lab

## :computer: Usage

There are 2 ways to use examples.

1. **Read**: You can read the notebook in Studio Lab without Studio Lab account. Please feel free to push **Open in Studio Lab** button in Examples section.
2. **Run**: You can run the notebook by copying the notebook or `git clone` the repository to your Studio Lab project.
3. **Share**: You can share the notebooks through the Git repository such as GitHub. [If you add Open in Studio Lab button](open-in-studio-lab), the readers can copy the notebook or clone the repository by clicking button.

### [Custom Environments](custom-environments/)

Thanks to the expandability of Jupyter Notebook, you can run not only Python but also another language Kernel such as R, Julia. Here is the example `environment.yml` files to set up the specific framework / language.

You can create the environment by copying the `.yml` file and right click copied `.yml` file in Studio Lab and select "Build Conda Environment".

#### Programming language environment

| No | Environment |
|----|-------------|
|   1| [R](custom-environments/R/R.yml)   |
|   2| [Julia](custom-environments/julia/1-install-julia.ipynb)   |

#### Speficic framework environment
