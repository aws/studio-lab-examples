## SageMaker Studio Lab Examples

Example Jupyter notebooks that demonstrate how to build AI/ML learning environment using Amazon SageMaker Studio Lab.

## :books: Background

SageMaker Studio Lab is a service for individual data scientist who wants to develop the career toward AI/ML practitioner. You can start your ML journey for free.

This repository introduces you to the way to set up Studio Lab according to your interest area, such as computer vision, natural language processing, etc. And also, we show how to deploy your project to the [Amazon SageMaker](https://github.com/aws/amazon-sagemaker-examples) to become the AI/ML practitioner.

## :hammer_and_wrench: Setup

Please follow the [Onboard to Amazon SageMaker Studio Lab](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/studio-lab-onboard.html).

1. Request a Studio Lab account
2. Create a Studio Lab account
3. Sign in to Studio Lab

If you would like to localize the user interface, please follow [the instruction for user interface localization](custom-environments/localization).

## :computer: Usage

1. **Read**: You can read the notebook in Studio Lab without Studio Lab account. Please feel free to click **Open in Studio Lab** button in Examples section.
2. **Run**: You can run the notebook by copying the notebook or `git clone` the repository to your Studio Lab project.
3. **Share**: You can share the notebooks through the Git repository such as GitHub. [If you add Open in Studio Lab button](open-in-studio-lab), the readers can copy the notebook or clone the repository by clicking button.
