# Add a Open in Studio Lab Button to Your GitHub Notebooks
Do you want to add that flashy [![Open in SageMaker Studio Lab](https://studiolab.sagemaker.aws/studiolab.svg)](https://studiolab.sagemaker.aws/import/github/aws/studio-lab-examples/blob/main/natural-language-processing/NLP_Disaster_Recovery_Translation.ipynb) button to your notebooks hosted on GitHub? It's really easy. Let me break it down for you in 3 steps.

### 1. Find the url for your file hosted on GitHub.
Just copy the url of the file you want to add the button to. This should work nicely for ipython notebooks (ending in `.ipynb`), but is currently not supported for markdown (ending in `.md`). For the button you see displayed above, the raw url is simply https://github.com/aws/studio-lab-examples/blob/main/natural-language-processing/NLP_Disaster_Recovery_Translation.ipynb.

### 2. Copy and paste the base syntax into your file as Markdown.
Next, get your hands on this base syntax. Here I'll render it as a code snippet for you.
```[![Open in SageMaker Studio Lab](https://studiolab.sagemaker.aws/studiolab.svg)](https://studiolab.sagemaker.aws/import/github/<your-org>/<your-repo-name>/blob/<your-branch-name>/<path-to-your-notebook>/<your-notebook.ipynb>)```

You can park that directly in your file. I like putting it right at the top, under the first header.

### 3. Modify that base url.
Your last step is just to make sure the link you're adding in your markdown or notebook file accurately reflects your actual GitHub directory structure. What's happening is that we are handling the hand off. You use this new url structure, which starts with  `https://studiolab.sagemaker.aws/import/github/`, and then close it off with your actual GitHub directory structure. Here is my modified url, rendered as a code snippet. ``` [![Open in SageMaker Studio Lab](https://studiolab.sagemaker.aws/studiolab.svg)](https://studiolab.sagemaker.aws/import/github/aws/studio-lab-examples/blob/main/natural-language-processing/NLP_Disaster_Recovery_Translation.ipynb)```. 

This means that the "open in Studio Lab" functionality will inherit all of the settings from the GitHub repository you are pointing to with this button. If you are pointing to a private repo, it will ask you to authenticate via GitHub and will only allow a download if you have access to that repository.

### 4. Share!
And that's about it! After that, anyone with this link will be able to make a copy of your notebook and clone it. They can either copy just that notebook, or clone the entire repository. As we mentioned in the example notebook on connecting SageMaker Studio Lab to your AWS account, just make sure **you are not under any circumstances sharing your AWS access and secrete keys on GitHub.**  That's effectively the same as letting anyone in the world access your compute resources, while you are still footing the bill. Strongly strongly not recommended.

### But what about permissions? Can they access my notebook on Studio Lab?
No way. All they are doing is pointing to your notebook stored on GitHub. So if you are publishing something to GitHub, then as long as they can access that GitHub repository, they can access your code. But at no time will they have any access to your environment or other of your files sitting on Studio Lab, that is fully private to you and you alone.

### How do I create an account on SageMaker Studio Lab?
Easy, just go to https://studiolab.sagemaker.aws and request an account.

### Copy the notebook, or clone the repository?
Studio Lab provides 15GB of persistent storage. If you think you are going to burn through that with a really large model, or with exploring a larger dataset, you might not want to clone a full repository, but instead just copy a notebook. When you use the "open in Studio" button, you can select either "Copy notebook" or "Clone entire repository." Make sure to pick the one that gives you the files you need, while not taking all of your storage.
